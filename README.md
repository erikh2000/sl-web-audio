# SL Web Audio

A library for loading, playing, and processing audio in a web browser. 

I don't think it's a library that competes well against others that are more coherently devised to fit user needs. This library is basically just the functions that I gradually accumulated as I wrote multiple web projects that used audio. And it's a great timesaver for me to collect them in one place.

Why would I not just use somebody else's library? My viewpoint is lengthily articulated in this article I wrote - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/write-more-reuse-less-fbf8a010c5f4

TL;DR - The costs of reusing other people's code are higher than one might intuit.

Why would you want to use this library?
* It could be a dependency for a more interesting project that I've released.
* It's not bad as a learning reference. My coding style is biased towards clarity and lack of dependencies. You might be inclined to snippet or copy-and-rewrite from it.

### Contributing

The project isn't open to contributions at this point. But that could change. Contact me if you'd like to collaborate.
