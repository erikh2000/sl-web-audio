The wrappers directory contains modules that thinly wrap DOM-provided functionality. There is little value in unit testing these modules, as they are mostly calls to DOM-provided APIs with little logic beyond that. So they are excluded from unit test coverage. If logic in these functions becomes more complex, refactor it such that the wrapper module is thin and the logic is moved to a separate module that can be unit tested.
